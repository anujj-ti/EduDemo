Environment & Project Structure
Framework: Use the p5.js library.

Essential Functions:

setup(): Initialize the environment (canvas creation, settings, etc.).

draw(): Continuously update the canvas.

Canvas Settings:

Define a reasonable canvas size (for example, using createCanvas(600, 600)).

Set a specific angle mode if needed (e.g., angleMode(DEGREES)).

Data Structure for Lesson/Step Management
Step Array:

Create an array (e.g., lessonSteps) to store each step of the animation.

Each element in the array is an object representing a single step.

Object Structure for Each Step:

text: A string containing the exact message or instruction for that step.

state: A generic object holding any state parameters needed to adjust the visual elements (in the original case, it was a time object, but it could be any set of properties).

State Management & Global Variables
Tracking Progress:

Use a global variable (e.g., currentStepIndex) initialized to 0 to track which step is currently active.

Dynamic State Variables:

Define global variables to hold any dynamic state (for example, properties that affect the drawing).

Initialize these variables based on the first step’s state if available, or with default values.

Drawing & Visual Representation
Rendering Elements:

Use the draw() function to clear the canvas and render all visual elements.

Implement functions to draw both static components (e.g., a background or a frame) and dynamic elements that change with each step.

Transformation & Alignment:

Use p5.js functions such as push(), pop(), and translate() to correctly position elements.

For rotations or other transformations, remember to account for any offsets (e.g., a -90 degree adjustment if necessary).

Text & Instruction Display
Display Message:

Render the instructional text from the current step (e.g., lessonSteps[currentStepIndex].text).

Text Styling:

Set font size using textSize() and alignment using textAlign(CENTER, CENTER).

Position the text clearly within the canvas, optionally using text wrapping by providing a width parameter to text().

Interaction & Step Transition
User Interaction:

Implement an event handler (e.g., mousePressed()) to control step transitions.

Step Transition Logic:

Increment currentStepIndex upon each mouse click.

Loop back to the first step if the end of the steps array is reached.

Update any dynamic state variables based on the new step’s state properties if provided.

Code Quality & Comments
Variable Names:

Use clear and descriptive names for variables and functions.

Documentation:

Include comments to explain:

The purpose of each global variable.

The structure of the data (e.g., the step objects).

The logic behind visual transformations and event handling.

Modularity:

Keep different parts of the logic (drawing, state updating, event handling) separated and well-documented.
