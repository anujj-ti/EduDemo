### **2\. Lesson Content & Activities (Standard Flow)**

* **2.1. Warm-up: "Clock Number Check" (\~1-2 mins)**  
  * **Goal**: Quickly activate number recognition 1-12 and their key positions on a clock face.  
  * **Screen**: Large clock face outline. Most numbers are shown. A maximum of 3 key numbers (e.g., 2, 5, 11 or similar, ensuring they aren't adjacent) are replaced with empty input boxes. Key anchors like 12, 3, 6, 9 should generally be present.  
  * **Character Prompt (Audio/Text)**: "Welcome, time explorers\! Let's quickly check this clock. A few numbers are missing\! Can you type the correct number in each empty box?"  
  * **Interaction**: Text Input. Student clicks an empty box; a simple number keypad appears. Student types the correct number for that position.  
  * **Feedback**: Correct entry fills the box permanently with a brief green check. Incorrect entry flashes red, clears input, prompts "Try again\!". Completion triggers a quick "Perfect\!" animation/sound.  
  * **Transition**: "Great\! All numbers accounted for. Now let's learn about the parts of the clock\!" (Next button enabled).
