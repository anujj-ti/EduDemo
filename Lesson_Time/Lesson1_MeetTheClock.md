**Overall Lesson Goal:** Students will be able to identify the basic parts of an analog clock (face, numbers, hour hand, minute hand) and understand the concept of clockwise direction.

**Specific Learning Objectives:** Upon completion of this lesson, students will be able to:

1. Identify the numbers 1 through 12 and their correct positions on a clock face.  
2. Identify the hour hand and describe its key characteristic (short).  
3. Identify the minute hand and describe its key characteristic (long).  
4. Distinguish between the hour hand and the minute hand based on length.  
5. Identify and describe the direction hands move on a clock (clockwise).

**Key Vocabulary Introduced:** Clock Face, Hour Hand, Minute Hand, Clockwise. (To be added to Glossary).

**Materials/Assets Needed:**

* Clear graphic of a standard analog clock face with interactive numbers/input boxes.

### **2\. Lesson Content & Activities (Standard Flow)**

* **2.1. Warm-up: "Clock Number Check" (\~1-2 mins)**  
  * **Goal**: Quickly activate number recognition 1-12 and their key positions on a clock face.  
  * **Screen**: Large clock face outline. Most numbers are shown. A maximum of 3 key numbers (e.g., 2, 5, 11 or similar, ensuring they aren't adjacent) are replaced with empty input boxes. Key anchors like 12, 3, 6, 9 should generally be present.  
  * **Character Prompt (Audio/Text)**: "Welcome, time explorers\! Let's quickly check this clock. A few numbers are missing\! Can you type the correct number in each empty box?"  
  * **Interaction**: Text Input. Student clicks an empty box; a simple number keypad appears. Student types the correct number for that position.  
  * **Feedback**: Correct entry fills the box permanently with a brief green check. Incorrect entry flashes red, clears input, prompts "Try again\!". Completion triggers a quick "Perfect\!" animation/sound.  
  * **Transition**: "Great\! All numbers accounted for. Now let's learn about the parts of the clock\!" (Next button enabled).

* **2.2. Learn It: "Clock Parts Explorer" (\~5-7 mins total, broken down)**  
  * **Learn It \- Chunk 1: The Face & Numbers (\~1-2 mins)**  
    * **Goal:** Introduce the clock face and the sequence of numbers 1-12.  
    * **Screen:** Completed clock face from warm-up.  
    * **Character Prompt:** "This is a **clock face**\! It helps us tell time. Look at the numbers. They go in order all the way around, starting from 1, then 2, 3... up to 12 at the very top." (Numbers 1-12 highlight sequentially).  
    * **Vocabulary:** "Clock Face" highlighted, added to Glossary.  
    * **Embedded Check:** "Quick check\! The numbers go in order. Click the number that comes **right after** the number 8." (Interaction: Click/Tap the number 9).  
    * **Feedback:** Correct highlights green ("Correct\!"). Incorrect highlights red ("Think about counting\! What number comes after 8? Find it on the clock face and click it.").

  * **Learn It \- Chunk 2: The Hands (\~2-3 mins)**  
    * **Goal:** Introduce and differentiate hour and minute hands.  
    * **Screen:** Clock face shows two hands (e.g., Blue=Short=Hour, Red=Long=Minute, pointing at 3:00).  
    * **Character Prompt:** "See these pointers? They are called hands\! This short, blue hand is the **Hour Hand**. It tells us the hour." (Hour hand highlights).  
    * **Vocabulary:** "Hour Hand" highlighted, added to Glossary.  
    * **Character Prompt:** "This long, red hand is the **Minute Hand**. It tells us the minutes." (Minute hand highlights).  
    * **Vocabulary:** "Minute Hand" highlighted, added to Glossary.  
    * **Character Prompt:** "Easy way to remember: Hour hand is short, Minute hand is long\!" (Brief visual comparison).  
    * **Embedded Check 1:** "Click on the **Hour Hand** (the short one)." Feedback: Correct highlights green. Incorrect prompts "Oops\! Remember, the hour hand is the *short* one. Click the short hand."  
    * **Embedded Check 2:** "Now, click on the **Minute Hand** (the long one)." Feedback: Correct highlights green. Incorrect prompts "Careful\! The minute hand is the *long* one. Click the long hand."

  * **Learn It \- Chunk 3: Clockwise Direction (\~2 mins)**  
    * **Goal:** Introduce clockwise movement.  
    * **Screen:** Clock face shows hands moving smoothly clockwise.  
    * **Character Prompt:** "Watch how the hands move\! They always go around in the same direction, past 1, 2, 3... This special direction is called **Clockwise**." (Show curved arrow animating clockwise ↻).  
    * **Vocabulary:** "Clockwise" highlighted, added to Glossary.  
    * **Embedded Check:** "Which arrow shows the clockwise direction?" (Show ↻ and ↺ arrows. Interaction: Click/Tap). Feedback: Correct highlights green. Incorrect prompts "Clockwise follows the numbers 1, 2, 3... Try again\!".

* **2.3. Try It: "Guided Hand Spotting" (\~5-7 mins)**  
  * **Goal:** Guided practice identifying hands and direction.  
  * **Screen 1 (Hand ID):** Clock at 6:00. Prompt: "Find the **Hour Hand**. Remember, it's the short one. Click it\!" Interaction: Click/Tap. Feedback: Immediate, explanatory (Correct: "You got it\! That's the short hour hand." Incorrect: "Hmm, that's the long hand. The hour hand is the *shorter* one. Click the short hand.").  
  * **Screen 2 (Hand ID):** Clock at 9:00. Prompt: "Now, find the **Minute Hand**. It's the long one. Click it\!" Interaction: Click/Tap. Feedback: Similar explanatory feedback.  
  * **Screen 3 (Direction):** Hands animate clockwise. Prompt: "Are they moving **Clockwise**? Click Yes or No." Interaction: Click/Tap Yes/No. Feedback: Explanatory (Correct: "Correct\! They are moving clockwise." Incorrect: "Look closely\! They are following the numbers 1, 2, 3... That *is* clockwise.").  
  * **Screen 4 (Direction):** Static clock face. Prompt: "Which way is clockwise? Drag the arrow around the clock in the clockwise direction." (Provide draggable arrow). Interaction: Drag-and-Drop arrow. Feedback: Explanatory (Correct: "Perfect\! That's clockwise\!" Incorrect: "Not quite. Remember, clockwise follows the numbers around...").

* **2.4. Do It: "Clock Detective Practice" (\~5-7 mins)**  
  * **Goal:** Independent practice identifying hands and direction with variety.  
  * **Format:** Series of 6-8 problems. Explanatory feedback after each attempt. Hands in diverse, non-overlapping positions.  
  * **Problem Examples:**  
    * 1 (MCQ): Clock at 2:30. "Which is the Hour Hand?" (A: Short hand, B: Long hand).  
    * 2 (Click/Tap): Clock at 8:15. "Click the Minute Hand."  
    * 3 (Click/Tap): Clock at 10:50. "Click the Hour Hand."  
    * 4 (T/F): Clock at 4:45. "The red hand \[or longer hand\] is the Minute Hand." (True/False).  
    * 5 (Click/Tap): Clock at 1:20. "Click the Hour Hand."  
    * 6 (Click/Tap): Clock at 7:05. "Click the Minute Hand."  
    * 7 (Yes/No): Animation of hands moving clockwise. "Are these hands moving Clockwise?" (Yes/No).  
    * 8 (Click/Tap): Show ↻ and ↺ arrows. "Click the arrow that shows Clockwise."  
  *   
  * **Variety Implementation:** Ensure varied hand positions across quadrants, minute hand not always at 12, hands clearly separated.  
  * **Feedback:** Explanatory as per standard 5.4.

* **2.5. Show It: "Clock Expert Check" (\~3-5 mins)**  
  * **Goal:** Assess mastery of objectives without hints.  
  * **Format:** 4 questions similar to 'Do It'. Results tracked.  
  * **Questions:**  
    * 1 (Click/Tap): Clock at 5:00. "Click the Hour Hand."  
    * 2 (Click/Tap): Clock at 8:00. "Click the Minute Hand."  
    * 3 (MCQ): Clock at 12:00. "Which hand is LONGER?" (A: Hour Hand, B: Minute Hand).  
    * 4 (Yes/No): Animation of hands moving clockwise. "Is this Clockwise?" (Yes/No).  
  *   
  * **Feedback:** Simple Correct/Incorrect per question. Overall score/status at end.  
  * **Remediation:** If \< 3 correct, offer targeted review (Learn It chunks or Try It) based on errors. If \>= 3 correct, proceed.

* **2.6. Extension: "Clocks Around Us" (Optional, \~2 mins)**  
  * **Goal:** Connect learning to the real world.  
  * **Screen:** Images of different analog clocks (wall, wrist).  
  * **Character Prompt:** "Wow, you're becoming a clock expert\! Clocks are everywhere. Can you spot the hour and minute hands on these? Maybe you can find a clock in your home or classroom later\!" (Exposure, no interaction).  
  * **Transition:** "Next time, we'll start learning what these hands actually tell us about the time\!" (End of lesson).
