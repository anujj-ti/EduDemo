## **Definitive Core Interactive Lesson Framework Template**

**Version:** 1  
**Date:** 3 Apr  
**Purpose:** This document provides the mandatory blueprint for the structure, components, standards, and guidelines for *all* interactive educational lessons generated by the system. It ensures consistency and quality across lessons targeting Grade 3 students (initially Math).

**1\. Interface, Navigation & User Experience**

* **1.1. Standard Screen Layout:**  
  * **Requirement:** All lessons *must* adhere to this fixed layout:  
    * **Top Banner:** Contains Character Guide prompts, key instructions, and potentially the Glossary/Help access.  
    * **Center Stage:** Main area for all interactive content, explanations, and activities.  
    * **Bottom Navigation Bar:** Contains all primary navigation and progress elements.

* **1.2. Bottom Navigation Bar Components:**  
  * **Requirement:** The Bottom Bar *must* consistently include these controls:  
    * **Previous Button:** Navigates to the previous step or screen within the lesson flow. (Disabled on the first step).  
    * **Next Button:** Advances to the next step or screen. (May be disabled until a task is completed).  
    * **Reset Activity Button:** Resets the *current interactive element or step* to its initial state (useful for re-trying a specific interaction). Does *not* reset the entire lesson. (May be hidden if not applicable to the current step).  
    * **Home Button:** Exits the current lesson and returns to the main lesson selection/dashboard.  
    * **Audio Controls:** Master Play/Pause for narration, Volume control.  
    * **Visual Progress Tracker:** (See 1.3).

* **1.3. Visual Progress Tracker:**  
  * **Requirement:** A horizontal, segmented progress bar located within the Bottom Navigation Bar.  
  * **Details:** Each segment clearly represents one core section of the lesson flow (Warm-up, Learn It, Try It, Do It, Show It, Extension). Completed segments are visually filled or marked (e.g., solid color, checkmark). The current active segment is distinctly highlighted. Hovering (on desktop) or tapping a segment might show the section name.  
      
* **1.4. Character Guide/Mascot:**  
  * **Requirement:** A consistent character providing guidance. Appears primarily in the Top Banner area.  
  * **Role:** Introduces topics/objectives, gives instructions (especially for new interactions), offers *optional* hints, delivers encouragement/feedback, highlights key points.  
  * **Usage Guideline:** Use strategically; avoid constant presence. Allow users to proceed without waiting for non-essential animations/dialogue.

* **1.5. Glossary & Help Access:**  
  * **Requirement:** Easy access to definitions and assistance.  
  * **Details:** Buttons typically located in the Top Banner or accessible via a menu icon in the Bottom Bar. Glossary populates dynamically with terms from the current and previous lessons. Help provides context-sensitive tips or general usage instructions.

* **1.6. Celebratory Feedback:**  
  * **Requirement:** Short, positive visual/audio cues for key achievements (e.g., completing a section, mastering 'Show It'). Integrated smoothly, not disruptive.

**2\. Standard Lesson Flow (The 6 Core Sections)**

*This mandatory sequence structures each lesson chunk.*

* **2.1. Warm-up (\~2-3 mins):** Quick interactive task activating prior knowledge. High engagement, low difficulty.  
* **2.2. Learn It (\~5-7 mins per concept):** Introduces *one specific learning objective/sub-skill*. Uses clear explanation (text/audio), visual demonstration, and 1-2 embedded check questions. Complex topics require multiple Learn/Try/Do cycles.  
* **2.3. Try It (\~5-7 mins):** Guided practice on the *exact* skill from 'Learn It'. Uses step-by-step instructions and *immediate, explanatory feedback* (see 5.4) for each action. Includes 2-3 examples with decreasing support.  
* **2.4. Do It (\~5-7 mins):** Independent practice (\~5-8 problems) on the specific skill. *Must* include varied problem types and contexts to ensure generalization and address common errors. Provides *explanatory feedback* after each attempt.  
* **2.5. Show It (\~3-5 mins):** Knowledge check (\~3-5 problems) assessing mastery of the objective *without hints*. Results determine progression. Failure triggers *targeted remediation* (revisit Learn/Try, or focused practice).  
* **2.6. Extension (Optional, \~2-5 mins):** Enrichment activity (challenge problem, real-world application, creative task) for students demonstrating mastery.

**3\. Core Interaction Types & Technical Standards**

* **3.1. Standard Interaction Methods:** Lessons will primarily utilize:  
  * **Click/Tap Selection:** For buttons, answers (MCQ, T/F), hotspots. Targets must be large and clear.  
  * **Drag-and-Drop:** For moving objects (e.g., labels, numbers). Must be smooth with clear targets/snap functionality where needed.  
  * **Text Input:** For typed answers (numbers, short words). Use large, clear fields.  
  * **Basic Animation Control:** Play/Pause for demonstrative animations.

---

**4\. Visual Design Standards** (Revised Section 4.4)

* **4.1. Core Principles:** The visual design *must* be clean, engaging, and free of clutter to maintain focus on learning. All visual elements must directly support the educational content and interactions. The overall aesthetic must be appropriate and appealing for Grade 3 students.  
* **4.2. Typography:**  
  * **Font Family:** A highly readable, standard sans-serif font *must* be used consistently across the entire interface (e.g., Arial, Helvetica Neue, Open Sans, or similar).  
  * **Font Sizes (Minimums):**  
    * Main Headings (e.g., Lesson Title): 28px  
    * Sub-Headings (e.g., Section Titles like "Learn It"): 22px  
    * Body Text / Instructions: 18px  
    * Button Text / Labels: 16px  
  * **Consistency:** Maintain consistent font weights and styles for corresponding elements throughout all lessons.  
* **4.3. Color Palette & Contrast:**  
  * **Palette Structure:** A consistent color palette *must* be defined and used, including Primary, Secondary, Feedback (Green for Correct, Red for Incorrect, Blue/Yellow for Hint/Info), and Text colors. (Specific hex codes TBD).  
  * **Contrast Requirement:** All text and meaningful graphical elements *must* meet or exceed WCAG 2.1 Level AA contrast ratios. Verification is mandatory.  
  * **Meaningful Use:** Color *must* be used purposefully for hierarchy, interactivity cues, feedback, and grouping.

* **4.4. Graphics & Illustrations:**  
  * **Quality & Clarity:** All graphics, icons, and illustrations *must* be high-quality, clear, and unambiguous in their meaning and purpose within the educational context.  
  * **Consistency:** The visual style of all graphics and illustrations *must* be consistent across all lessons to maintain a cohesive user experience.

* **4.5. Visual Feedback:** Interaction feedback (e.g., button presses, correct/incorrect answers) *must* be indicated immediately through clear visual cues (e.g., color changes using the standard feedback colors, checkmarks, borders, brief animations).

**5\. Assessment & Feedback Framework (WIP)**

* **5.1. Purpose:** Primarily formative assessment integrated throughout the lesson flow ('Learn It' checks, 'Try It' feedback, 'Do It' practice) with a summative check ('Show It') for each objective.  
* **5.2. Assessment Integration:** Follows the structure in Section 2 (Embedded checks, 'Show It'). Optional pre/post assessments for larger modules can be added.  
* **5.3. Question Variety:** Utilize diverse, appropriate question formats (MCQ, drag-drop, text input, interactive tasks).  
* **5.4. Explanatory Feedback Standard:**  
  * **Requirement:** All feedback on practice ('Try It', 'Do It') and assessment ('Show It') attempts *must* be explanatory.  
  * **Correct:** Briefly reinforce the concept/reason.  
  * **Incorrect:** Clearly state it's incorrect, explain *why* (referencing the rule/concept simply), and guide towards the correct process. Avoid negative language. Use encouraging tone.  
* **5.5. Motivation:** Simple reward system (e.g., stars for 'Do It' questions, badges for 'Show It' mastery) integrated non-disruptively.  
* **5.6. Adaptation:** 'Show It' results *must* trigger targeted remediation paths for non-mastery (See 2.5). Difficulty can adapt based on performance trends.

**6\. User Instruction Guidelines**

* **6.1. Language:** Simple, direct, explicit instructions. Grade 3 reading level. Define new terms upon first use.  
* **6.2. Delivery:** Multi-modal (visual text/cues \+ audio narration). Consistent messaging.  
* **6.3. Timing:** Provide instructions exactly when needed for the task.  
* **6.4. Demonstration:** For *any* new interaction type, provide a brief, clear visual animation demonstrating the action *before* the student attempts it.
